## OVERVIEW
Chess Game designed in Python using Min-Max algorithm and Alpha Beta pruning.
## CONCLUSION
Alpha Beta Pruning is an optimization method to the minimax algorithm that allows us to disregard some branches in the search tree. This helps us evaluate the minimax search tree much deeper, while using the same resources. Alpha-beta pruning is based on the situation where we can stop evaluating a part of the search tree if we find a move that leads to a worse situation than a previously discovered move. Alpha-beta pruning does not influence the outcome of the minimax algorithm â€” it only makes it faster. Alpha-beta algorithm also is more efficient if we happen to visit first those paths that lead to good moves
